    // The default screen size used by the engine is 426x240, a common
    // resolution for the standard 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. The ubiquity
    // of 16:9 displays makes 426x240 a great choice for playing retro games in
    // computer monitors, televisions and mobile devices.
    //
    // Popular videogames of the 90s used the 4:3 aspect ratio. A good choice
    // for a 4:3 retro game is 320x240.
    //
    // You may aim for higher resolutions. 640x360 is also a good choice for
    // retro games that will be played in widescreen displays. There are many
    // other standard resolutions (including HD) which you can research online.
    //
    // Tip: keep the default size or make an informed decision. 426x240 is a
    // very good choice for retro games. If you change it, you'll most likely
    // have to adapt your game.
